# Hashchain  

## Introduction
`hashchain` is a Python package developed to join the easiness of Python with the security of blockchain to certify that your important records haven't been tampered. 

The core module creates a hash chain, attesting that no record can be tempered one saved. The blockchain module save a proof of your hashchain permanentely in the most secured way. Then, it's impossible to alter the haschain without causing a discrepancy with the blockchain.  

No need for third party certification anymore. No more single point of failure nor certification costs. 

## Installation
This python package is available on PyPi package manager. I recommend installing it in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).  
1. Open a terminal and run the following command : `pip install hashchain`
2. Import the package in you script with `import hashchain`
